## Overview
The plant pathogenic fungus *Diplocarpon coronariae* is a major causative agent of apple Marssonina leaf blotch, affecting the global apple industry safety. We isolated a purified XN1 strain of *D. coronariae* via single spore technology, assembled its genome to T2T levels, and presented a precise full-length transcriptome using PacBio sequencing and manual curation. Based on high-quality assembly and gene annotation, we discovered that LTR-RTs drove structural variations and gene evolution within and between species of *D. coronariae*. Furthermore, we assembled a young chromosome specific to *D. coronariae*, designated as Chr15.

Here, we have uploaded all the codes related to this study to this repository after sorting, aiming at knowledge sharing and improving the reproducibility of our research.
